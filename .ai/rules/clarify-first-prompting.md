# Clarify-First Prompting Strategy

When users provide simple or ambiguous prompts, ask targeted clarifying questions before proceeding. This ensures accurate implementation and prevents wasted effort.

## Core Principle

**Ask before assuming, but don't over-ask.**

The goal is to gather essential information that significantly impacts implementation, not to quiz the user on every detail.

## When to Clarify vs. Proceed

### PROCEED Without Asking When:

- The request is clear and specific
- Standard patterns obviously apply
- You can infer reasonable defaults from context
- The codebase provides clear conventions to follow
- Changes are easily reversible

### ASK for Clarification When:

- Multiple valid interpretations exist
- The choice significantly impacts architecture
- User preferences are essential (UI/UX, naming, etc.)
- Mistakes would be costly or time-consuming to reverse
- Security or data handling decisions are involved

## Question Formulation Rules

### Rule 1: Maximum 1-2 Questions at a Time

Don't overwhelm users. Focus on most critical unknowns.

**Bad:**

```
Before I proceed, I need to know:
1. What authentication method?
2. What database?
3. What ORM?
4. What session handling?
5. What password policy?
6. What MFA approach?
```

**Good:**

```
Before implementing authentication, I need to clarify:

1. **Authentication Method**: Which do you prefer?
   - a) OAuth 2.0 (Google, GitHub, etc.)
   - b) Email/password with JWT
   - c) Magic link (passwordless)

2. **User Storage**: Where should user data be stored?
   - a) Your existing database (I'll check schema)
   - b) New dedicated user table
```

### Rule 2: Provide Options with First as Default

Always structure questions with options, making the first option the default if no answer is given.

**Format:**

```
**Question**: Brief description
- a) First option (default/most common)
- b) Second option
- c) Third option
```

### Rule 3: Include Context for Each Option

Help users understand the implications of each choice.

**Example:**

```
**State Management**: How should we handle client state?
- a) React Context (simpler, good for small-medium apps)
- b) Redux Toolkit (more boilerplate, better for complex state)
- c) Zustand (minimal API, good performance)
```

### Rule 4: Infer from Codebase First

Before asking, check if the codebase already answers the question.

Before implementing a feature:

Let me check:

1. Existing API patterns in the codebase
2. Database/ORM being used
3. Authentication middleware
4. Response formatting conventions

If these are clear from the codebase, I don't need to ask.

## Ambiguity Detection Patterns

### Vague Action Words

Triggers: "add", "implement", "create", "build", "make", "fix"

**Example:**

- "Add authentication" → Need: method, storage, session handling
- "Fix bug" → Need: which bug, reproduction steps, expected behavior
- "Create a dashboard" → Need: what data, user roles, layout preferences

### Missing Scope

Triggers: No clear boundaries mentioned

**Example:**

- "Refactor code" → Need: which files, what aspects, target improvements
- "Improve performance" → Need: which operations, current metrics, target goals
- "Update API" → Need: which endpoints, backward compatibility, versioning

### Technology Choices

Triggers: Multiple valid solutions exist

**Example:**

- "Add a database" → Need: SQL vs NoSQL, which provider, local vs cloud
- "Set up testing" → Need: unit vs integration vs e2e, framework preference
- "Deploy app" → Need: platform, infrastructure, CI/CD requirements

### User Experience Decisions

Triggers: Design/UX choices involved

**Example:**

- "Add a form" → Need: validation style, error display, submit behavior
- "Create a modal" → Need: trigger, dismissal, animation preferences
- "Build navigation" → Need: structure, mobile behavior, active states

## Domain-Specific Templates

### Authentication

```
Before implementing authentication:

1. **Authentication Type**: Which method do you prefer?
   - a) OAuth 2.0 (Google, GitHub, etc.)
   - b) JWT-based email/password
   - c) Magic link / passwordless
   - d) Multi-factor authentication (MFA)

2. **Session Management**: How should sessions be handled?
   - a) Stateless JWT tokens (scalable, no server storage)
   - b) Server-side sessions (more control, requires storage)
```

### API Development

```
Before creating an API endpoint:

1. **Response Format**: What structure should responses follow?
   - a) Follow existing API conventions (I'll check the codebase)
   - b) REST with standard HTTP status codes
   - c) GraphQL (if applicable)

2. **Authentication**: Should this endpoint be protected?
   - a) Yes, require authentication
   - b) No, public access
   - c) Mixed (some actions require auth)
```

### Database Operations

```
Before implementing database changes:

1. **Migration Strategy**: How should we handle the schema change?
   - a) Create migration file (recommended for production)
   - b) Direct schema modification (development only)

2. **Data Handling**: Any existing data to consider?
   - a) No existing data (new table/field)
   - b) Migrate existing data (I'll propose a strategy)
```

### UI Components

```
Before building this component:

1. **Styling Approach**: Which styling method should I use?
   - a) Follow existing project patterns (I'll check)
   - b) Tailwind CSS
   - c) CSS Modules
   - d) Styled Components

2. **Responsive Behavior**: Mobile considerations?
   - a) Mobile-first responsive
   - b) Desktop-only for now
   - c) Adaptive (different layouts per breakpoint)
```

### Testing

```
Before implementing tests:

1. **Test Type**: What level of testing?
   - a) Unit tests (isolated function/component testing)
   - b) Integration tests (multiple components together)
   - c) End-to-end tests (full user flows)
   - d) All of the above

2. **Coverage Focus**: What's the priority?
   - a) Critical paths only
   - b) Comprehensive coverage
   - c) Match existing test patterns
```

## Handling User Responses

### When User Chooses an Option

Proceed immediately with the selected approach. No need to confirm again.

### When User Says "You Decide" or Similar

Use the first (default) option and proceed. Mention what you chose:

```
I'll use OAuth 2.0 with Google as the primary provider, as it's the most common choice. Let me implement that...
```

### When User Provides Partial Info

Fill in reasonable defaults for missing information:

```
You've specified JWT authentication. I'll use:
- Access tokens (15min expiry)
- Refresh tokens (7 days)
- HTTP-only cookies for storage

Let me implement this...
```

### When User Asks for Recommendation

Provide a clear recommendation with brief justification:

```
For your use case, I recommend **Zustand** for state management:
- Minimal boilerplate
- Great TypeScript support
- Easy to test
- Perfect for your app's complexity level

Shall I proceed with Zustand?
```

## Progressive Clarification

For complex features, clarify in stages rather than all at once:

### Stage 1: High-Level Direction

```
You want to add a payment system. First, let me understand:

**Payment Provider**: Which service should we integrate?
- a) Stripe (most popular, excellent docs)
- b) PayPal
- c) Other (please specify)
```

### Stage 2: After Initial Answer

```
Great, we'll use Stripe. Now:

**Payment Types**: What payment flows do you need?
- a) One-time payments only
- b) Subscriptions only
- c) Both one-time and subscriptions
```

### Stage 3: Implementation Details

```
Perfect. For subscriptions with Stripe, I'll:
1. Set up Stripe Customer objects
2. Create subscription checkout flow
3. Handle webhooks for lifecycle events
4. Build a customer portal for management

Any specific plans or pricing tiers I should implement?
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Don't Ask Obvious Questions

**Bad:** "Should I use proper error handling?" (Obviously yes)

### Don't Ask About Implementation Details

**Bad:** "Should I use `const` or `let`?" (Follow project conventions)

### Don't Ask When Codebase Provides Answers

**Bad:** "Which CSS framework should I use?" (Check existing code first)

### Don't Repeat Questions

**Bad:** Asking the same thing after user already answered in the conversation

### Don't Ask About Reversible Choices

**Bad:** "Should I put this file in `/utils` or `/helpers`?" (Just pick one)

## Agentic Verification (Don't Ask - Just Check!)

### NEVER Ask About Things You Can Verify

Instead of asking, use tools to find out:

| Don't Ask                     | Just Check                           |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| "Is Node.js installed?"       | `run_terminal_cmd("node --version")` |
| "What framework is this?"     | `read_file("package.json")`          |
| "Does file exist?"            | `read_file("path/to/file")`          |
| "What's current structure?"   | `list_dir("./")`                     |
| "Is this package installed?"  | `read_file("package-lock.json")`     |
| "What version are you using?" | Check config files first             |

### Proactive Context Gathering

Before asking ANY clarifying question, first:

```
1. CHECK PROJECT STATE
   → list_dir to understand structure
   → read_file for package.json, pubspec.yaml, Cargo.toml
   → grep for existing patterns

2. CHECK TOOL AVAILABILITY
   → run_terminal_cmd to verify CLIs exist
   → Check versions match requirements

3. CHECK EXISTING CONVENTIONS
   → How are similar features implemented?
   → What patterns does the codebase use?

4. ONLY THEN ASK about things you genuinely can't determine
```

### Example: User Says "Add Authentication"

**❌ Wrong Approach:**

```
Before I add authentication, I need to know:
1. What framework are you using?
2. Do you want JWT or sessions?
3. What database do you have?
```

**✅ Right Approach:**

```
Let me check what exists first:
- read_file("package.json") → Oh, it's Next.js 14
- read_file("prisma/schema.prisma") → PostgreSQL with Prisma
- grep("auth") → No existing auth implementation

Now I know the context!
```

### When Version Matters - Web Search First

Before implementing framework-specific features:

```
1. web_search("Next.js 14 App Router authentication December 2024")
2. web_search("shadcn/ui latest installation method 2024")
3. Context7 for detailed API docs
```

This prevents writing outdated code or using deprecated patterns.
